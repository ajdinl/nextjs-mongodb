## NextJS app with MongoDB connection and basic CRUD operations

First clone this repo ( type in terminal 'git clone git@github.com:ajdinl/nextjs-mongodb.git'), then install all dependencies with 'npm install'.\
When installation is finished go to https://www.mongodb.com/ and create account if you dont have, and then create cluster, database and collection.\
Connect mongodb with this application (copy MONGODB URI to .env file), and update MONGODB_COLLECTION in .env file with your collection name.\
After this setup above, write in console npm run dev and you can use this application in development mode at localhost ('http://localhost:3000/').\

Thank you for using this application.

Best regards,
Ajdin
